# Behavior Tracker 

The Behavior Tracker app was designed to help special education teachers track their students problem behaviors on a daily basis. Behaviors are tracked using the following criteria: time, activity, frequency of instances and duration of instance . A notes section is also provided in case we need to note a change in routine (e.g. change in medication dose, new staff member, change in living situation, recovery from sickness, return from prolonged vacation). The purpose of this tracker is to help reveal possible environmental factors that may affect rates of problem behaviors .
